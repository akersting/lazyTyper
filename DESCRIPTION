Description: lazyTyper adds the concept of strong typing to R. Before its first
    use, a variable can be declared to be of a specific type. Existing variables
    can be casted to a specific type. Assigning values of the wrong type to such
    typed variables will throw an error. In addition to pure type information,
    it is also possible to associate additional properties with a variable, e.g.
    the length of a vector. Such properties are also validated when the variable
    is modified. Furthermore, lazyTyper extends R with (partial) support for
    constants.
