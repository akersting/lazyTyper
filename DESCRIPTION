Description: lazyTyper adds the concepts of strong and explicit typing to R. 
    Before its first use, a variable can be declared to be of a specific type. 
    Existing variables can be casted to a specific type. Assigning values of the 
    wrong type to such typed variables will throw an error. In addition to pure 
    type information, it is also possible to associate additional properties 
    with a variable, e.g. the length of a vector and whether it may contain NAs 
    or not. Such properties are also validated when the variable is modified.
